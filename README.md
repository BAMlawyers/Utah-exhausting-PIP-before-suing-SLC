# Do I Have to Exhaust PIP Before Filing a Lawsuit in Salt Lake City?

In Utah, injured parties cannot sue the at-fault driver for bodily injury until they meet specific legal thresholds. One of the most misunderstood requirements is whether you must **exhaust your PIP (Personal Injury Protection) benefits first**.

This guide explains the legal framework, strategy, and statute governing the tort threshold under Utah’s no-fault system.

---

## Quick Answer

Yes. If your total medical expenses are **less than $3,000**, you generally **cannot file a lawsuit** for bodily injury in Utah, even if the other party is 100% at fault.

This threshold is designed to prevent minor claims from entering the court system.

---

## Governing Statute

### Utah Code § 31A-22-309(1)(a)
> "A person may not maintain an action for general damages arising out of personal injuries alleged to have been caused by an automobile accident unless that person has incurred medical expenses in excess of $3,000."

## What Does “Exhausting PIP” Mean?

Utah auto policies include **a minimum of $3,000 in no-fault PIP coverage**. “Exhausting PIP” means your medical treatment has used up this $3,000 benefit. You must show that your actual, necessary, and reasonable medical costs **exceed** this amount before you can sue for:

- Pain and suffering
- Emotional distress
- Future medical expenses
- Loss of enjoyment of life

---

## Exceptions to the $3,000 Threshold

Even if your medical expenses are below $3,000, you may still sue if you suffered:

1. **Permanent disability**
2. **Permanent disfigurement or dismemberment**
3. **Fracture of a bone**
4. **Permanent impairment based on AMA guidelines**
5. **Death**

See Utah Code § 31A-22-309(1)(a)(ii).

## Strategy Tip: Why PIP Exhaustion Matters

If you file a lawsuit **before** exhausting PIP, the defense may file a motion to dismiss under Utah Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Courts will generally grant it unless you qualify for one of the statutory exceptions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I file the lawsuit now and amend after reaching $3,000 in medical bills?**  
Yes, but this carries risk. The defense may move to dismiss the case if the threshold is not yet met at filing. Best practice is to **document exhaustion first**.

**Q: Can I bypass the $3,000 threshold if I broke a bone?**  
Yes. A bone fracture satisfies the tort exception under § 31A-22-309(1)(a)(ii). You may sue even if your bills are under $3,000.

**Q: Do chiropractic or mental health bills count toward the $3,000 threshold?**  
Yes, if the treatment is **reasonable, necessary, and related to the crash.** These must be properly documented.

**Q: What if the insurer only paid $2,000 of my $3,500 medical bills?**  
You must show that you **incurred** $3,000 or more in crash-related medical costs. Insurer payment is not the controlling factor—**your medical billing is.**

**Q: Can I sue if my PIP was denied or underpaid?**  
Possibly. But you must first challenge the denial and **prove your bills exceed $3,000**. See [Repo 2: PIP Denial Remedies].

## Actionable Steps

1. **Track your PIP balance.** Request a benefits ledger from your insurer or adjuster.
2. **Gather itemized billing.** Add up all crash-related treatment costs.
3. **Wait until your bills exceed $3,000** before initiating litigation unless a statutory exception applies.
4. **Secure documentation of bone fractures, scars, or permanent impairment** if you're using an exception to the dollar threshold.
5. **Ensure all treatment is medically documented** and causally related to the crash.

## Common Pitfalls

- Filing suit too early, before hitting $3,000
- Counting non-covered services (e.g., massage without prescription)
- Overreliance on ER or urgent care billing that is later reduced
- Assuming PIP denial equals automatic threshold clearance
